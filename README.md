In this code we have implemented an assembler which converts the assembly code into binary.
It also raises errors for syntactical mistakes or anamolies.
We have used functions as our approach to deal with different instructions.

Likewise we have also tried to implement the further parts which would be required later in other submissions.

We have used double traversal techniques to correctly get labels and variable addresses.
